\chapter{Introduction}
This project was kickstarted by researchers Anne Smith (Biology) and Christine Helling (Astronomy), with the aim of using the completed system to determine how the population would react to the discovery of alien life. This would be done through use of the system in some experimental context, however the details on what form this would take remain unclear. 


\section{Objectives}
As part of my Description, Objectives, Ethics and Resources (DOER) document I described the objectives of this project:

\subsection{Primary Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Devise and implement a game that presents the player with scenarios and allows them to choose from potential responses
    \item Devise and implement a flexible infrastructure to model and constrain scenarios and their impacts
    \item In collaboration with Anne Smith and Christine Helling, devise a sample set of appropriate scenarios with impacts and populate the game.
    \item Devise and implement an infrastructure for capturing and recording player responses
    \item Implement basic visualisation of responses
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Secondary Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Devise and implement an admin centre to allow easy creation of new game content
    \item Carry out an experiment to assess the effectiveness of the game as a tool to assess people's real world views
    \item Create more advanced visualisation and analysis tools
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Tertiary Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perform a wider user experiment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definitions}
Throughout this text I will use the following words defined as so:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Player - A user playing the game through the UI
    \item Admin - An user that has access to the game maker and visualisation applications 
    \item Game definition - A game within the context of the framework I have created. A unique game definition consists of a set of cards, a set of pillars, and a starting deck
\end{itemize}
