\chapter{Context Survey}

Here I will review the existing software and literature around the different aspects of this project. 


\section{First Contact}
This project has been undertaken in collaboration with the Exoplanet Research Society, who aim to answer the question - how would humans react to the discovery of alien life?
There has been some research~\cite{ReactionsToMessage, HowReactDiscovery, Fear} into this area, but it is certainly not extensive and very little of it is systematic. The topic is vast, and is made more complex by many factors that could affect the answer:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How has extra-terrestrial life been discovered?
    \item What is the nature of the life, is it intelligent?
    \item Is alien life on our doorstep, or far enough away that it could never reach or harm us?
\end{itemize}
Anne Smith and Christine Helling believe it could be beneficial to create a game capable of collecting this information, in order to reduce the burden on participants answering such an extensive library of questions and improve engagement. This format of gathering opinions would allow the player to become immersed in the context of the quesiton, hopefully leading to more honest responses.

If it was possible to accurately capture players' thoughts and feelings in this manner, this would have potential to impact the way opinion data is collected across multiple faculties.

\section{Survey Gamification}
An emerging trend in modern business practice, gamification can be defined as `using game mechanics and game design elements to measure, influence and reward user behaviors.'~\cite{7804551}. 
There has been some research into gamification as a tool to improve the quality of responses from and engagement with surveys. From this I aim to gain an awareness of the necessary considerations when designing and implementing gamification.

As of yet, most experiments into survey gamification have only gone so far as to change the wording of survey questions, show questions alongside imagery or change the answer input mechanics.
My project represents a considerable departure from the standard survey format, with the goal being that the game could be enjoyed as a standalone experience. 
Because of this, there are many psychological considerations as to the validity of the results that can be gathered through this format. There exists a tradeoff between complex levels of gamificaiton that increase enjoyment, and the accuracy of respondent data. It is also difficult to be certain whether player's will respond the same way in a game as they would in real life.
While deep investigation of these issues is not my goal, I deemed it important to understand them, in an attempt to minimise any bias that my framework could impose onto players.

A 2011 paper found that while participants' enjoyment of the survey is generally increased, there are three main aspects of gamification that can affect the `character of the data'~\cite{GameExperiments}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{cotd.\arabic*}]
    \item\label{cd:q} Effects caused by changes to the question and how it is interpreted
    \item\label{cd:m} Effects caused by changing the attitude and mindset of respondents
    \item\label{cd:l} Effects caused by changes to the design and layout of question
\end{enumerate}
These considerations are targeted towards the low levels of gamification previously discussed, where the questions still have a fairly standard format - I do however believe that they are still applicable to my project. 

A key aspect of the framework I designed is the context that is persistent between questions, and affected by player's choices. In researching this I found a 2015 paper~\cite{Olympic} that states `Designers may also implement feedback loops, i.e., dynamics wherein user actions affect the overall state of gameplay. Feedback loops may visualize concepts such as a userâ€™s progress, status, wealth, health, points, etc.'. 
This gives me confidence that adding a persistent context to the game is a valid design decision.
As for how this will affect the character of the data, I believe this relates to~\ref{cd:q}. 
This is because changing the context effectively changes the question, as people may respond differently under different circumstances. 

\ref{cd:l} will also occurr in my artifact - where there is a UI to interact with, there is potential to influence the way the user interacts with it. I will attempt to minimise this risk - ideally the only bias imposed on a player's decision will be from the game definition itself.

Briana Brownell, Jared Cechanowicz, and Carl Gutwin summarise the state of research into survey gamification as follows:
`In most cases, their results show that the addition of these game elements increases the length and quantity of responses, and respondents typically prefer the gamified version to the standard survey version. However, their research does not compare the effectiveness of game elements in gamified surveys. They have also found that that some gamified survey designs can lead to compromised respondent data (Puleston \& Sleep, 2011).'~\cite{SurveyGamificationResearch}.
This indicates that there is promise in the notion of gamifying surveys - however it can result in a reduction in accuracy of the data collected. Depending on the extent to which the survey is abstracted from, precise details, both of the question and response, can be lost. Given this, gamification is likely best suited to situations in which the surveyors need broad answers, rather than precise ones.

\section{Similar Software}

\subsection{Datagame}
Datagame~\cite{Datagame} is a company that offers services allowing researchers to create and publish gamified surveys. This is done through interfaces that are heavily game-influenced, such as word searches and decks of cards.

Datagame supplies the tools required to populate one of several template games with custom questions, and export this to an online format that can be played through many channels including Facebook~\cite{Facebook}. 

Datagame offer four game types available to customise. The one most similar to the game I intend to create is referred to as a `Swiper' game. In this, the player draws cards from a virtual deck, each of which presents a yes/no question. The user swipes the card left or right to answer yes or no respectively. Figure~\ref{fig:datagame} shows this interface - it is fairly simple, with no standout features other than those added during admin configuration. Customisation options include allowing the user to replace card backgrounds with images, as well as change the colour of the text. Figure~\ref{fig:dg_editor} shows an example of the game editing view in which the following aspects of the game can be edited:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Project title
    \item Title question
    \item List of cards
    \item Card name
    \item Card text/images
    \item Toggle card shuffling
    \item Game UI labels
    \item Background image
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Qualifio}
Qualifio~\cite{Qualifio} offer a similar service. They provide more varied game formats than Datagame, but the presentation is less game-like. 

\subsection{Reigns}
I based my framework proposal on an existing game, Reigns~\cite{Reigns}. 
In Reigns, the player takes the role of a medieval ruler, and makes binary decisions to solve problems their subjects approach them with. 
These decisions affect the scenarios that may later appear, as well as changing how the ruler is perceived by various factions, such as their population, army, and church. 
The player's success is measured by how many decisions they can make without falling out of favour with any of the factions.

As of 2019-03-01, Reigns is a well reviewed game, with a rating of 4.7/5 on the Google Play store~\cite{GooglePlay}. 
Given this, in addition to the relative simplicity of recording and analysing the binary choices, I believe the framework of Reigns could provide a good starting point for collecting player opinion data.
