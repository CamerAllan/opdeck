\chapter{Requirements}

Below are the software requirements that I specified before starting the implementation of OpDeck.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\newcounter{AdminReq}
\newcommand{\adminreq}[1]{\item \textbf{Admin} {#1}\stepcounter{AdminReq}}
\stepcounter{AdminReq}

\newcounter{UserReq}
\newcommand{\userreq}[1]{\item \textbf{User~~~} {#1}\stepcounter{UserReq}}
\stepcounter{UserReq}

\newcommand{\hpr}{\textit{High Priority~~~~~}}
\newcommand{\mpr}{\textit{Medium Priority~}}
\newcommand{\lpr}{\textit{Low Priority~~~~~~}}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{FR.\arabic*}]
    \userreq{\hpr A user can read and respond to scenarios presented to them}
    \userreq{\hpr A user can lose a game, when the value of one of their pillars reaches zero}
    \userreq{\mpr A user can enter a unique id, under which their game data will be recorded}
    \userreq{\mpr A user can choose a game to play by entering the game code}
    \userreq{\mpr A user can see the effect that their responses will have on the pillars}
    \userreq{\mpr A user can lose a game, when there are no more cards in the deck}
    \userreq{\lpr A user can view an image related to the current scenario}
    \adminreq{\hpr An administrator can add, edit and remove cards from a game definition}
    \adminreq{\hpr An administrator can add, edit and remove pillars from a game definition}
    \adminreq{\hpr An administrator can save a game they are editing and return to it later, or let users play it}
    \adminreq{\mpr An administrator can select specific cards and obtain visualisations that summarise how players respond to them}
    \adminreq{\mpr An administrator can export and download all game data to an appropriate data processing format}
    \adminreq{\lpr An administrator can filter turns included in visualisations by the state of the game during those turns}
    \adminreq{\lpr An administrator can save their progress in editing one game and switch to another}    
    \adminreq{\lpr An administrator can view a summary of the game they are creating, which contains information on any machine detectable oversights and game balance}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{NR.\arabic*}]
    \item All interfaces are clear and intuitive
    \item The game interface is responsive to input - there should be minimal delay between an input action and the outcome
    \item The game interface does not influence the user's choice in a way that is not customisable
    \item User data should be stored securely
\end{enumerate}
