\chapter{Requirements}

\todo[inline]{Elaborate on requirements}

Below are the requirements that I specified early on in the project.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
        \item A user can enter a unique id, under which their game data will be recorded
        \item A user can choose a game to play by entering the game code
        \item A user can, read and respond to scenarios presented to them
        \item A user can see the effect that their responses will have on the pillars
        \item A user can lose a game, when the value of one of their pillars reaches zero
        \item An administrator can add, edit and remove cards from a game definition
        \item An administrator can add, edit and remove pillars from a game definition
        \item An administrator can view a summary of the game they are creating, which contains information on any machine detectable oversights and game balance 
        \item An administrator can save a game they are editing and return to it later, or let users play it
        \item An administrator can save their progress in editing one game and switch to another
        \item An administrator can select specific cards and obtain visualisations that summarise how players respond to them
        \item An administrator can filter turns included in visualisations by the state of the game during those turns
        \item An administrator can export and download all game data to an appropriate data processing format
\end{itemize}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item All interfaces are clear and intuitive
    \item The game interface is responsive to input - there should be minimal delay between an input action and the outcome
    \item The game interface does not influence the user's choice in a way that is not customisable
    \item User data should be stored securely
\end{itemize}
