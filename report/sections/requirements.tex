\chapter{Requirements}

Below are the requirements that I specified early on in the project.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A user can
    \begin{itemize}
        \item enter a unique id
        \item choose a game to play
        \item while playing a game,  
        \begin{itemize}
            \item read a card
            \item view pillar levels
            \item choose a response
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item An administrator can
    \begin{itemize}
        \item while authoring or editing a game,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item add, edit and remove cards
            \item add, edit and remove pillars
            \item view a contextual game summary
            \item save the game to a database
            \item switch to editing another game
        \end{itemize}
        \item while visualising results,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item select cards to visualise
            \item filter cards by game state
            \item export data to file
            \item view visualisations showing users' interactions with the game
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item All interfaces are clear and intuitive
    \item The game interface is responsive to input - there should be minimal delay between an input action and the outcome
    \item The game interface does not influence the user's choice in a way that is not customisable
    \item User data should be stored securely
\end{itemize}
