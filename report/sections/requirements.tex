    A user can choose a game to play by entering the game code}\label{4}
    \userreq{\hpr

    Depends on: \ref{4}\ 
    \userreq{\hpr 
    
    A user can lose a game, when the value of one of their pillars reaches zero}\label{2}
    
    Depends on: \ref{1}\ 
    \userreq{\mpr 

    A user can enter a unique id, under which their game data will be recorded}\label{3}
    \userreq{\mpr 
    
    A user can see the effect that their responses will have on the pillars}\label{5}


    Depends on: \ref{1}\ 
    \userreq{\mpr 
    
    A user can lose a game, when there are no more cards in the deck}\label{6}

    Depends on: \ref{1}\ 
    \userreq{\lpr

    Depends on: \ref{1}\ 
    \adminreq{\hpr 
    
    An administrator can add, edit and remove cards from a game definition}\label{8}
    \adminreq{\hpr 
    
    An administrator can add, edit and remove pillars from a game definition}\label{9}
    \adminreq{\hpr 
    
    An administrator can save a game they are editing and return to it later, or let users play it}\label{10}
    \adminreq{\mpr 
    
    An administrator can select specific cards and obtain visualisations that summarise how players respond to them}\label{11}

    Depends on: \ref{4}, \ref{1}\ 
    \adminreq{\mpr 
    
    An administrator can export and download all game data to an appropriate data processing format}\label{12}

    Depends on: \ref{4}, \ref{1}\ 
    \adminreq{\lpr 
    
    An administrator can filter turns included in visualisations by the state of the game during those turns}\label{13}

    Depends on: \ref{1}\ 
    \adminreq{\lpr 
    
    An administrator can save their progress in editing one game and switch to another}\label{14}
    \adminreq{\lpr 
    
    An administrator can view a summary of the game they are creating, which contains information on any machine detectable oversights and game balance}\label{15}

    Depends on: \ref{8}, \ref{9}\

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{NR.\arabic*}]
    \item All interfaces are clear and intuitive
    \item The game interface is responsive to input - there should be minimal delay between an input action and the outcome
    \item The game interface does not influence the user's choice in a way that is not customisable
    \item User data should be stored securely
\end{enumerate}
