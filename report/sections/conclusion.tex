\chapter{Conclusion}
Comparing my project to the software I found to be most like mine, Datagame \cite{Datagame}, I find that my software holds up well. I believe the game I have created is as engaging, if not more so than the games available on Datagame. Both game makers offer a similar toolset, and while I cannot speak for any analysis tools that Datagame provides, I believe the functionality provided by my analysis tools - combined with data export functionality - is sufficient. As previously stated, I cannot evaluate the accuracy with which the tool can infer player's opinions, however it may provide a point from which research into this area can proceed.

My game has achieved or surpassed the majority of my goals, and I feel confident that it could provide the grounds for further research into the world of gamification and opinion gathering.
