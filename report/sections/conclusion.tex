\section{Future Work}
All of the feature requests raised by participants in the study would make for worthwhile future work, in addition to many other quality of life and aesthetic updates. Here I will elaborate on future technical work, as implementation details weren't much discussed in the presentation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The response system could be expanded and generalised to support different numbers of responses for different cards, rather than two for each.
    \item Depending on the final use case, it may be desirable to add support for collecting user demographic data, such as age and gender. This would require frontend work, in making the appropriate forms, as well as increased security for communication (SSL) and encrypted storage on the backend.
    \item Currently the application only deploys locally, some work would be required in implementing a permentant hosting solution, however this wouldn't be too difficult as this is well supported for Node.
    \item The visualisation tool could be endlessly expanded to become a more capable analysis suite. If more user data was added, there exists the possibility of filtering by age bracket and various other factors.
\end{itemize}
