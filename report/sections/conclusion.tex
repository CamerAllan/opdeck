\chapter{Conclusion}
Comparing my project to Datagame~\cite{Datagame} and Qualifio~\cite{Qualifio}, I find that \od{} holds up well. 
I believe the game I have implemented is at least as engaging as the games available on these other platforms. 
\od{} and Datagame offer similar game creation capabilities, and while I cannot speak for the analysis tools provided by these other services, I believe the functionality provided by \od{}, combined with its capability to export data, is sufficient. 
As previously stated, further research is required to evaluate the accuracy with which this tool can infer player's opinions. 
Despite this, \od{} has achieved or surpassed the majority of the original objectives, and I feel confident that it could provide the grounds for further research into the world of gamification and opinion gathering.
