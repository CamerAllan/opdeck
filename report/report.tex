\begin{abstract}
  There are many situations in which it is desirable to know the opinions of a population. 
  Traditional opinion polls have been used extensively throughout history, with paper surveys giving way to their online counterparts. 
  This has made it possible to reach a much wider audience, while giving the surveyor more control over input restriction and validation.
  A further benefit of surveys in the digital age is the possibility of enrichment through various gamification methods. 
  While there do exist tools designed to gamify surveys, these are limited in depth - the interface and the wording of questions can be modified, but at their core the outputs of these products still adhere to the traditional Q\&A format.
  In collaboration with the St Andrews Centre for Exoplanet Science~\cite{CfES}, this project focuses on creating a framework that implements gamification at a deeper level - moving away from the Q\&A format. 
  Within this framework, games may be created, played, and visualised, with the aim of inferring user's opinions on certain subject matters through gameplay analysis. 
  The framework is designed to be highly flexible, allowing all aspects of a game's story and development to be decided by an administrator.
